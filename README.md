DevKit Entities Module
======================

Entity serves as a base class for game elements in DevKit. It provides functionality for coordinates in a game-space; circular and rectangular bounds for offsetting views and hitboxes; basic physics including velocity, acceleration, and collisions; and a lifecycle interface to easily facilitate entity pooling.

This module includes the Entity base class, EntityPhysics as a default physics component, and EntityPool to efficiently recycle entities.
